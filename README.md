# Astro25
Code for class


This repository has some code that I have used for my Astro 25 course at Dartmouth College, W26 with Jonathon Cohn. 
At the moment, I believe this repository will just have the code I have used for my Term Project. 
I used the code to create my shapes and count how many cosmic voids were within my parallelogram band. Hopefully the link in my paper works!
